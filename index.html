                            Lets cut the crap and admit the truth. Movie critics 
                            can be harsh and overrated. They expect to much and never give fair reveiews.
                            This is where we come in as a community! 
                            With this website you can search up and movie and provide
                            a proper review of what you thought, so that others can see 
                            what their peers think instead of relying on 
                            movie critics (BOOOOOO!). Sure rotten tomatoes and other 
                            ratings may get it right sometimes, but every movie 
                            is being advertised as "the best movie of the century/decade"
                            and I just don't trust them anymore. 
                            I would rather see what normal everyday people
                            think about the movies instead of trusting the critics. 
                            So watch a movie and then come back and leave your thoughts 
                            about it on our website! <strong>NO SPOILERS</strong> please!

                            you guessing on whats going to happen next may be the 
                            perfect thing for you. Well look no further because you are in

                            Whether you enjoy PC or console gaming we use one of the 
                            largest gaming API's/Database to allow you to search, reveiew, 
                            and find other games for your liking. 
                            Help others find games for them by leaving meaningful reveiews 
                            as well as finding more games for you to enjoy! 
                            Enter a game title and we will use the API to return various games 
                            that are similar to it that you might want to buy. Before buying
                            be sure to read other peoples reveiws of the game! 
                            Just like the movies every company out there rates games either 
                            better or worse than they really are. Theres been a drought of 
                            good games being released, so leave a great reveiw about a game that either
                            encourages or discourages someone from buying the game!
