        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I work for this business and would like to update his website so that it's more modern and provides better functionality.
            His current website contains nothing but information and it isnt as pretty as it could be, so I 
            would be updating the graphics and making it editable by himself instead of outsourcing to other companies and not being able to update it himself.
            
            His detailing services typically include paint corrections (removing scratches and swirls from the paint), polishing (clean up the paint to make it shinier),
            ceramic coating (puts a coating on the paint for protection), and various interior choices. Prices vary dapending on the condition of the car,
            so one of the apps id like to add to the page is for customers to send in pictures of the condition of their car as well as their email, phone number, and name.
            This will let him get a good idea of the price he will have to charge if the person is unable to bring their car by the shop that day.

            Another thing I would like to add in addition to his website is a place for people to leave review of the work they got done. Of course theres already other places to leave reviews
            on the intenet, but having it directly on his website would be easier access to potential customers. They will be able to directly see all the great work we do!

            Having an area for him to sell products could also improve his profits!

            Essentially I think his current website is clunky and I think I can improve it a lot as well as giving me some great practice!
